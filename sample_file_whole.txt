***Beatles Song***

LYR-IWBL
It won't be long yeh, yeh, yeh
 It won't be long yeh, yeh, yeh
 It won't be long yeh, till I belong to you

***Beatles Song***

LYR-ICI
I've got every reason on earth to be mad
 Cos I've just lost the only girl I had
 And if I could get my way


***Beatles Song***
LYR-AHDN
It's been a hard day's night, and I've been working like a dog
 It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log
 But when I get home to you I find the things that you do
 Will make me feel alright



***Beatles Song***

LYR-IBB
You know if you break my heart I'll go
 But I'll be back again
 Cos I told you once before goodbye
 But I came back again





***Beatles Song***
LYR-IAL


This happened once before
 When I came to your door
 No reply
 They said it wasn't you
 But I saw you peep through your window
